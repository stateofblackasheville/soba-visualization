# State of Black Asheville: Visualization Library

As part of the 2018 Code for America Community Fellowship, we developed a visualization library built on React + ChartJS.

This library helps you visualize data stored in either:
1. A Google Docs Spreadsheet
2. GraphQL Endpoint

Learn more about our GraphQL endpoint [here].
